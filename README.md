# Pawdle iOS App

## App Overview

A good friend of yours loves dogs, but struggles to remember which breed is which. They have approached you to see if you can build an app that will help them remember. Theyâ€™d love an app that shows them a
picture of a dog and asks them which breed it is- and gives them a warm sense of satisfaction when they get it right.

## What I Would Add Next

- Testing support for the repositories. Perhaps by injecting a mock network layer with relevant spy methods to capture functionality within the repository functions.
